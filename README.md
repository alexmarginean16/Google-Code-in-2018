# :gear:Google-Code-in-2018

This repository includes all of my tasks I've done from Fedora organization during Google Code-in 2018 contest.

I spent about 1 and a half months working on tasks and communicating with mentors and other participant from the Fedora organization on telegram. Taking part in Google Code-in was the best decision for me and my career because I this contest pushed me to learn new things and things that are actually used by people that are far more important than the things we learn at school.

Code-in didn't just help me to get started with my coding career but it had a big impact on my talking and communication skills in the English language.
