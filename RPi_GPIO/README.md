# RPi_GPIO
This is a code that controls a PIR, DHT11, LED and LDR by a press of a button. (This is meant for a Google Code-in Task) 

## The GPIO pins - Fedora Project
### Task description

General Purpose Input/Output pins are the bridge to interface with the real-world environment. There are various options for both Input and Output as listed below:

Input:

          * Temperature and Humidity (DHT11)
          * Photo-resistor
          * Infrared (M395)
          * Passive Infrared Motion sensor
          * Gas/Smoke/Alcohol (check out MQ series of sensors)
          * Real Time Clock (RTC) -(DS1307)
          * Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Output:

          * DC Motor
          * Servo Motor
          * Relay

In this task, you can take any board of your choice (boards from ESP family/boards from Arduino family/Raspberry-pi family/Breadware boards/or any micro-controller) and interface the above I/O with the board.

### Deliverables: 

Share the code, screen-shot of Serial Monitor, circuit diagram and the photo of your constructed circuit.

- Minimum four inputs
- Minimum one output
