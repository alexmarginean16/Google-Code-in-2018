## Automation using Ansible - Fedora Project
### Task description

Automate https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Testcase_base_service_manipulation using ansible (roles).

Take some other daemon instead of sshd and put it in a variable so that it can be changed/more services can be added later.

Submit the link to a repo with a playbook and the roles.
