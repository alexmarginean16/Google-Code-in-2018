# app-design

In this task I've suggested how a redesign of the Fedora App home screen should look like. The issue can be seen in [Fedora Pagure](https://pagure.io/Fedora-app/issue/115) and files can be accessed from this repo.

## Design a new home screen for Fedora App - Fedora Project
### Task description

Introduction - We have a Fedora Community Application that allows Fedora users as well as interested contributors to know whatâ€™s going on in the community. The current home screen houses a split screen design with carousel, it is not really intuitive to the new users, and we believe it can be simplified.

### Goal:

Design a new home screen for the Fedora App

### Suggested Approach:

List down all the features which we should show on the home screen and experiment with different layouts. Post them on Pagure issue and we will collectively figure out something

### Deliverables:

Images of the new home screen design with complete flow Create a PR on Pagure once done.
