# arduino-task

## Getting started with Arduino - Fedora Project
### Task description

The entire task is divided into two subtasks: Setting up the board for NodeMCU; and Interfacing and changing the brightness of an LED.

### Requirements:

Arduino (any board)/NodeMCU (any board from ESP8266 family) LED 1 Resistor [320-520 Ohm] (less the resistance bright the intensity, hence no resistance high intensity which further burns the LED)

### Task:

Install the Arduino IDE on Fedora; Set up the IDE for NodeMCU board; Add the library for DHT11, ESP8266WiFi and ESP8266HTTPClient;

Interface an LED and change the brightness of the LED (print this on the Serial Monitor indicating the analog Values);

### Deliverable:

Screen-shot of your installation; Screen-shot of the board which shows the option for NodeMCU board; Screen-shot of Include Library from tools which shows the option for the required Libraries; Sketch (code) for varying LED brightness; Screenshot of the Serial Monitor.
