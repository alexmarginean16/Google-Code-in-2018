## Mobile site: footer misplacement - Fedora Project
### Task description

The Fedora Happiness Packets site doesn't look too great on mobiles (http://happinesspackets.fedorainfracloud.org/)

Could you fix the content in the footer by:

1. Aligning all content of footer in center
2. Have social media buttons in one row and use a smaller icon.

You might need to brush up on your CSS (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid)

And for the fonts, you can look into font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
