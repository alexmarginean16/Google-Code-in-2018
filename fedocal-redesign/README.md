# fedocal-redesign

I contributed to FedoCal(Fedora Calenar) so it uses fedora-bootstrap instead of it's own CSS.
- My [fork](https://pagure.io/fork/margi/fedocal) on Fedora Pagure.

## Style FedoCal - Fedora Project
### Task description

[FedoCal](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/calendar) (Fedora Calendar) is an application used to track different fedora meetings and events such as test days. It is a web app designed using Python, HTML and CSS. You can find its source code [here](https://pagure.io/fedocal). [Fedora Bootstrap](https://pagure.io/fedora-bootstrap) is a customization of the popular Bootstrap CSS framework for use in Fedora apps and maintain a consistent look and feel. We need to update FedoCal to use Fedora Bootstrap.

### Goals

Modify the HTML and CSS of FedoCal to use Fedora Bootstrap without sacrificing functionality.

### Deliverables
