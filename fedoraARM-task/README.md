## Blog post about booting a Fedora ARM image to Raspberry PI - Fedora Project
### Task description

Fedora is a Linux distribution developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Raspberry Pi is an ARM-based mini “computer” used for prototyping embedded computing projects. The [Fedora ARM installer](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Raspberry_Pi#Fedora_or_other_Linux_Distributions) is a quick and easy way to prepare an SD card with a Fedora image that is bootable on a Raspberry PI.

Note:
1. You must try this in a real Raspberry Pi (any version) and add the screenshots.
2. You must not submit plagiarized content (no copy-paste). Always make sure the content is your own.

### Goals

Verify the steps and prepare a blog post for creating a Fedora Raspberry Pi bootable SD card.

### Deliverables

- Create a blog post and share it here
- The post can be a Google Docs document, a Word document or a Github Gist written in markdown.
