# serial_blinker-task

Arduino project that changes the state of a LED based on serial monitor input.

## Communication over Serial Monitor - Fedora Project
### Task description

The task can be accomplished in two ways:

- Using the components
- Through simulator (tinkercad.com)

### Task:

Read the data from Serial Monitor as ON/OFF and based on which turn the state of LED.

### Components:

- Arduino/NodeMCU/(any Arduino IDE friendly board)
- LED
- 1 Resistor [320-520 Ohm] (less the resistance bright the intensity, hence no resistance high intensity which further burns the LED)

### Deliverable:

- Sketch (code)
- Circuit Diagram
- Constructed Circuit
- Screen-shot of Serial Monitor
