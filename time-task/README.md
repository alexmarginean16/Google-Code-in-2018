## Connecting with the internet -GET the time - Fedora Project
### Task description

In order to communicate over any network you either transmit or receive the data. In this task, you have to receive the data using an API.

You have to connect your board to the internet (preferably through WiFi). Then make an API of any website which provides you time in your local time-zone. You have to send a GET request, and read the time and print it on the Serial Monitor/Terminal.

Preferred Boards: NodeMCU &#124; Raspberry PI &#124; Arduino + ESP8266

### Deliverable:

The sketch (code), the circuit diagram (if you have used any external module to connect) and API link.
